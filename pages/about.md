intro_paragraph: >
  I am an experienced analyst that found a passion for the UX-UI aspect of
  software engineering. I feel happiest when I see software engineering teams
  succeed in building future-friendly products that customers love. I am
  versatile, creative and energetic  and can manage ambiguous situations and
  effectively collaborate in teams.
---
I understand the importance of architecture and design, and the impact it has on systems and people. I have a keen interest in enterprise architecture and am TOGAF certified. The balancing act in making sound technology decisions in the front-end UX space, requires the right mix of values, strengths and skills, all I believe I have.

I am looking for an opportunity where my design thinking, technical and analytical skill and experience in development and architecture can add value to your software engineering team.

## Strengths

I persist through challenges and setbacks by staying creative and learning.

## Values

```
Kindness
```

```

```

```
Courageousness
```

```
Knowledge

## Skills

I am capable to see projects trough from end to finish because of my diverse skill set. I traverse levels and stages during the lifecycle of a software development process and have a talent to connect concepts, people, processes and things in relation to each other.  

### Discover

I am studious, highly analytical and have artistic skill. This lets me see things from different angles and equips me with a novel approach to solving problems. I am able to notice new things and gather insights. I am a competent story-boarder and illustrator and enjoy leading whiteboard sessions to unpack a problem domain.

### Define

Through my analytical skills, I am able to break a problem down in a logical and systematic manner. I am able to prioritize and discern between the various pieces and prioritize accordingly.

I am able to deliver clear specifications that frame fundamental design challenges. I am able to express logically the functional requirements of systems at the appropriate level of detail (granularity).

### Develop

My programming skills are at a level that let me amend, refactor moderately complex programs and scripts in order to help a software engineering team and designer deliver prototypes to improve and refine ideas.

### Deliver

I enjoy helping teams and individuals execute project deliverables. I do this by creating structure, organising things and making complex matters understandable.

## Career Summary

My first on-boarding project in the IT industry was over 20 years ago in 1996, as Web Designer and HTML author. In 1998 I was part of the front-end design and development team when News24 first launched their online web news service. Since this date, I have worked in IT across various business disciplines, performing a variety of roles.

Both my skills and interests have matured over the past two decades. I have enjoyed working for media companies and have extensive experience working in the telecommunications industry.

While I have a keen interest in all matters related to architecture, I have focused almost exclusively on establishing and maturing the frontend design (UX-UI) and development discipline at the organisation I work for.

## Personal Development

To future proof my career, I am keen to complete a few short courses or diplomas in Human Computer Interaction and or Design Thinking. I am particularly interested in the impact of AI on UX, and am keen to look at human interaction with machine intelligence.

## Formal Education

## More about me

I am an avid runner and have completed quite a few half-marathons. I started running in 2014 and plan to enter my first full marathon in 2020.

I create maps of worlds, creatures and characters that only exist in my imagination as far as I can tell.
Sometimes I write down stories which unfold from the fantasy worlds I dream up.

Once in a while I enjoy socialising with a few good friends by taking part in fantasy themed role-playing game campaigns, (think Dungeons and Dragons).
