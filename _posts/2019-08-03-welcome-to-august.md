  Once upon a time there was a user, who was the Hero in your story. The Hero
  died. The End. How do we ensure that we are in control of what happens to the
  heroes, our users, in the products we design for their user stories?

Joseph Campbell is best known for his book: The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga. But is it possible that Campbell's work is relevant to UX Design and Solutions Architecture? I suspect we can find a deeper meaning and more nuanced influence than the obvious analogy between [user journeys and the hero's journey](https://velocitypartners.com/blog/why-customer-journey-is-a-heros-journey/). 

In short, the Hero's Journey consists of 3 main stages:

1. Departure
2. Initiation and
3. Return

How much power do we yield over the adventures (the stories) our heroes, the users experience as they interact with the systems we design and build for them?

In this blog post series, I will share why I consider Joseph Campbell's work as highly relevant as we design and develop complex systems for people who need to feel like heroes. 

1. The Ordinary World
2. The Call to Adventure
3. Cross the First Threshold
4. Trials, Friends and Foes
5. Magical Mentor (or the Mentor with Supernatural Aid)
6. Dragon's Lair
7. Moment of Despair
8. Ultimate Treasure
9. Homeward Bound
10. Rebirth & The Champion's Return
