  Once upon a time there was a user, who was the Hero in your story. The Hero
  died. The End. How do we ensure that we are in control of what happens to the
  heroes, our users, in the products we design for their user stories?

Joseph Campbell is best known for his book: The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949), which George Lucas credited as influencing his Star Wars saga. Google the hero's journey and you will find many diagrams that map the journey of the archetypal hero found in world myths. In short, the journey consists of 3 main stages:

1. Departure

2. Initiation

3. Return

As designers responsible for responding to the pitfalls of adventures, which our heroes, the users take part in, how much power do we yield over how our users end up being the heroes they were destined to be?

In this blog post series, I will share why I consider Joseph Campbell's work as highly relevant as we design and develop complex systems for people who need to feel like heroes. 

The Ordinary World

1. The Call to Adventure
2. Cross the First Threshold
3. Trials, Friends and Foes
4. Magical Mentor (or the Mentor with Supernatural Aid)
5. Dragon's Lair
6. Moment of Despair
7. Ultimate Treasure
8. Homeward Bound
9. Rebirth & The Champion's Return
